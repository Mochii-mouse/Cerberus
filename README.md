# Cerberus

Functions:
 - Moderation:
    bans & unbans members,
    kicks members,
    deletes a soecified number of messages with the clear command,
    shows the join date of members with the join_date command.
 - General:
    shows bot latency with ping command,
    loads and unloads cogs.
 - Fun:
     Pee command makes the bot respond with 'Cerbeus pees on {member}',
     8ball command takes a question and sends a random answer from a list.
 - Current project:
     Bot will randomly spawn creatures if a message has been sent in a specified channel in the last 10 minutes, if someone replies with 'Catch' within 30 seconds,
     the bot will respond with 'Caught'.
     Future plans for this are to state who caught the creature, and store this information to create a leaderboard that can be shown with a command.
